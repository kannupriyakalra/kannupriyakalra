# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kannupriya Kalra

**Engineering Leader & Scala Developer | AI Educator & Community Builder | Open Source Mentor**

With over a decade of experience designing scalable backend systems using functional programming, I specialize in building resilient, high-availability platforms with Scala. At Sky, London, I led critical backend development using functional Scala to power large-scale operations.

A passionate contributor to the Scala ecosystem, I co-created **LLM4S**, a Scala-first AI platform, and have actively contributed to projects like **Scala CLI** and **Scaladex**. I serve as a **Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Org Admin & Mentor (2024, 2025)** with the Scala Center, mentoring contributors and helping grow the next generation of open source developers.  
I also maintain several open source projects, including **Scaladex**, **LLM4S**, and various initiatives under **Google Summer of Code**.

I'm also building a global AI community focused on responsible and accessible AI development. I offer AI training and education for developers and teams â€“ bridging the gap between functional programming and practical AI applications.  
Currently collaborating with **Manning Publishing**, I'm developing learning resources to help engineers navigate the future of **Generative AI**.

As a seasoned international speaker, Iâ€™ve delivered talks in 8+ countries at events such as **Scala Days**, **Google Open Source Conference**, and **Bay Area Scala Conference**, engaging audiences on AI, functional programming, data engineering, and software design.
